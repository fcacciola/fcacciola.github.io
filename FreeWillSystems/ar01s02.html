We sense that even though we are not always able to do whatever we want, for example under restrain, what we do is for the most part what we decide to do. Even under coercion, for instance, we clearly sense that we ultimately agree to delegate control based on some cost/benefit balance and we can always take control back if the cost becomes too high. That is, we clearly sense to have <span class="strong"><strong>free-will</strong></span>.</p><p>On the other hand, as soon as we start to rationally think about it, it becomes less and less clear what sort and degree of free-will we have, if we do at all. Is it <span class="emphasis"><em>freedom of action</em></span>? <span class="emphasis"><em>freedom of thought</em></span>? <span class="emphasis"><em>freedom of choice</em></span>? the <span class="emphasis"><em>ability to do otherwise</em></span>? Do we all have the same free-will whether children or adult, educated or illiterate, physically/mentally ill or healthy? now and then? How does our free-will, whatever and however that is, relates to moral responsibility?</p><p>Not only is it difficult to rationalize our strong sense of free-will on itself, it happens to conflict more and more with our progressive view of the world. Already at the ancient times, when we knew little about nature and our fate was considered to be in the hand on Gods, thinkers wondered how can we have freedom of choice if our fate is to be decided, even if only partially, by such deities. Later, we started to take note of the way in which the components of the universe (such as atoms) work, everywhere from rocks to our body, and nothing seemed to indicate that there is free-will in such components, which makes it even more difficult, if not straight up incompatible, to make sense of our strong sense of having free-will nonetheless.</p><p>This conflict between our strong sense of having free-will and the difficulty of constructing a proper model for it that rationally coexist with our models of the world is known as <span class="strong"><strong>the free-will problem</strong></span>, and it&#8217;s been around for thousands of years (see Doyle <a class="link" href="ar01s04.html#ref-doyle_free_2011">2011</a>, ch.&nbsp;7 for a detailed account of the history of the problem).</p><p>Being such an ancient problem, almost every opinion about it has been written, reviewed and debated. From the idea that free-will is just an illusion (the most popular these days), to the idea that we humans, or at least brain-possessing animals, have free-will despite the way the universe works, to the idea that in fact the universe does not really work the way we commonly think and itself possesses free will (Conway and Kochen <a class="link" href="ar01s04.html#ref-conway_free_2006">2006</a>)</p><p>This book joins the worldview of the last group: that we humans do in fact have free-will because free-will is a fundamental property of the very fabric of the universe (thus, not just us but <span class="emphasis"><em>everything</em></span> has it).</p><p>In order to present such a thesis, this book is divided in 3 parts.</p><p>In part one, the idea of free-will itself is decomposed and elaborated in detail, and the concept of a free-will system is presented. A free-will system is proposed as a system in which <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> its elements have free-will yet it can self-organize in such a way as to <span class="emphasis"><em>display</em></span> the sort of deterministic patterns we observe in, for example, nature.</p><p>In part two, a specific metaphysical worldview is <span class="emphasis"><em>postulated</em></span> in which the actual universe is presented as a model for a free-will system, such that human free-will, for example, can be both explained and properly characterized on the basis of that worldview.</p><p>In part three, the practical and conceptual consequences of the proposed metaphysical worldview, such as possible ways to test the postulates, considerations about the future and the nature of predictability (specially on natural sciences), evolution, moral responsibility, etc&#8230; are discussed.</p><p>Finally, an appendix, after part three, attempts to elaborate the basis of a calculus of free-will operators.</p><p>The reader should know that this book does not pretend to contain the solution to such an ancient problem. It does make a stance (that we do have free-will), and tries to provide conceptual support for that claim using a bottom-up approach that, based on the proposition of how things <span class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span> be and work, attempts to find human free-will and to match our current models of nature. But this book does not pretend to show that things really are and work that way, only that they could in the sense that all our current physical models are compatible with it.</p><p>In that sense, this book merely adds yet another metaphysical view to the problem of free-will.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s01.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center">&nbsp;</td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ar01s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">1.&nbsp;Free Will Systems&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Overview of Dynamic Systems</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
