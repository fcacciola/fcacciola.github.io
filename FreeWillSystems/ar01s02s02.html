Ordinarily, <span class="emphasis"><em>change</em></span> is thought as a function of <span class="emphasis"><em>time</em></span> and over* space.* That is, there is change whenever any property at one instant is different from the property at another instant; and the set of all possible properties to change from and to exist all by itself. For example, <span class="emphasis"><em>motion</em></span> is ordinarily defined as <span class="emphasis"><em>change of position over time</em></span>, such that both the time along which, and the space over which, the motion occurs, is fundamental and external to the motion itself. However, this work prefers the opposite view: that is, <span class="strong"><strong>change is an elemental phenomena</strong></span>&#8212;not derived from other principles&#8212;such that time and space are really just <span class="emphasis"><em>aspects</em></span> of change. That is, <span class="strong"><strong>time and space are consequence of change</strong></span>, not the other way around. Regarding time and space as derived aspects of change poses the problem of finding a definition of change without resorting to these two concepts. This work attempts to do that by resorting not to time and space, but to some more fundamental time-like and space-like concepts instead. Doing so, however, appears to solve the conceptual circularity between change, time and space at a merely linguistic level, without any real conceptual substance, but the following details attempt to show the conceptual utility of the chosen approach.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s02s01.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ar01s02.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">2.1.&nbsp;Objects and States&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
