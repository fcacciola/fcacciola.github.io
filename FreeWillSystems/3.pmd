Any object, whether a proper object such as a computer system, or a distinction drawn from reality, such as a *person*, has a state (i.e. the collection of all its properties, along with the corresponding collection of all the variables we use to represent such a state), yet that state might *change*.
Ordinarily, *change* is thought as a function of *time* and over* space.* That is, there is change whenever any property at one instant is different from the property at another instant; and the set of all possible properties to change from and to exist all by itself. For example, *motion* is ordinarily defined as *change of position over time*, such that both the time along which, and the space over which, the motion occurs, is fundamental and external to the motion itself. However, this work prefers the opposite view: that is, **change is an elemental phenomena**---not derived from other principles---such that time and space are really just *aspects* of change. That is, **time and space are consequence of change**, not the other way around.
Regarding time and space as derived aspects of change poses the problem of finding a definition of change without resorting to these two concepts. This work attempts to do that by resorting not to time and space, but to some more fundamental time-like and space-like concepts instead. Doing so, however, appears to solve the conceptual circularity between change, time and space at a merely linguistic level, without any real conceptual substance, but the following details attempt to show the conceptual utility of the chosen approach.
